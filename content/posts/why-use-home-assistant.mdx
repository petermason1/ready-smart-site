# Why Use Home Assistant Instead of the Cloud?

Thinking about going local with your smart home setup? Here's why we recommend pairing your devices with **Home Assistant** instead of relying entirely on cloud-based platforms like Alexa or Google Home.

## The Case for Local Control

Local automation means your smart home runs inside your home â€” not in someone else's data center.

Hereâ€™s what you gain:

- **ðŸ”’ Privacy** â€“ Your data stays on your network and out of third-party servers.
- **âš¡ Speed** â€“ Automations trigger instantly, with zero cloud delay.
- **ðŸ”§ Flexibility** â€“ You can integrate more devices and customize everything.
