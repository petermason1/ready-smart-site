## Local vs Cloud: What's the Big Deal?

Here’s why we recommend Home Assistant:

- **Privacy** — your data stays in your home
- **Speed** — automations run instantly, even with no internet
- **Flexibility** — integrate almost anything

Cloud platforms like Alexa are great, but pairing them with a local controller like Home Assistant gives you the best of both worlds.
