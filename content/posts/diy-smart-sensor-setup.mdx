# How to Set Up a DIY Smart Sensor

Want to take your smart home to the next level? Building your own sensors gives you full control, better privacy, and serious flexibility. Here's how to make it happen.

## What You’ll Need

To get started, gather these parts:

- ✅ **ESP32-S3 Mini** – the brains of the build  
- ✅ **LD2410B or AM312** – mmWave or motion sensor  
- ✅ **Breadboard & jump wires** – for easy prototyping  
- ✅ **Resistors, LED (optional)** – for basic visual indicators

## Step 1: Wiring It Up

Start by connecting:

- Power (3.3V or 5V depending on sensor)
- Ground
- Signal pins (GPIOs — usually D2/D3)
- Test with the Arduino IDE or ESPHome

## Step 2: Flash and Test

- Use ESPHome or Arduino IDE
- Load a YAML config or test sketch
- Check logs to confirm detection triggers work properly

## Step 3: Add to Home Assistant

Once detected in ESPHome, add the sensor to your dashboard:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: gpio
    pin: GPIO2
    name: "Hallway Motion Sensor"
    device_class: motion
