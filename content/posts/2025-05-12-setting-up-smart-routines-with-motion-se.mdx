Setting up smart routines with motion sensors involves using your smart home app (like Alexa, Google Home, or Philips Hue) to create a new routine where the motion sensor detecting movement acts as the trigger. You then define the actions that should occur when motion is detected, such as turning on lights, adjusting the thermostat, or playing music. You can often add conditions like time of day for the routine to be active.
