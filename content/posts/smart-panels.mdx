# Why Brilliant Smart Panels Are the Future of Home Control

If your home is full of switches, apps, and voice assistants, it might be time to simplify. **Brilliant** wall panels are replacing messy smart home setups with a sleek, all-in-one touchscreen.

## 1. One Panel, Total Control

These panels replace your existing light switches and give you:

- Touch control for lights, scenes, and music  
- Visual intercom with built-in camera  
- Live view of your doorbell or security cams

## 2. Works with Everything

Brilliant integrates with:

- Alexa, Google, Ring, Hue, LIFX  
- Sonos, Ecobee, SmartThings and more  
- Home Assistant via community integrations

## 3. Looks the Part

No more plastic hub or messy tablets stuck to the wall. This is built-in, flush-mounted, and properly smart looking.

You can control:

- Scenes with a tap  
- Music volume per room  
- Camera feeds and routines — right from the wall

## Is It Worth It?

If you’re serious about clean home control without shouting “Alexa” 20 times a day, it’s a game-changer.

You can start with one panel for your main hallway or kitchen — and expand later.
