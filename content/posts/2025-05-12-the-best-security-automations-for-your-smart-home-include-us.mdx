The best security automations for your smart home include using motion sensors to trigger lights, automating smart locks based on schedules or presence, setting security cameras to record when sensors are triggered, receiving instant mobile alerts for any sensor activity (door, window, motion), integrating sensors with a smart alarm system, automating the closure of garage doors, and linking safety devices like smoke/CO detectors to actions such as unlocking doors or turning on lights. I attempted to publish a blog post detailing these automations.
