Here are some of the best security automations for your smart home:

1.  **Automated Lighting (Presence Simulation):** Lights turn on/off randomly or based on motion to make it look like someone is home, deterring intruders.
2.  **Smart Lock Integration:** Linking smart locks with alarms or lights so the system arms/disarms and lights adjust automatically when the door is locked/unlocked.
3.  **Motion Sensor Triggered Alerts and Recording:** Motion in key areas triggers camera recording and sends instant alerts to your phone.
4.  **Smart Doorbell Integration:** See and talk to visitors remotely via a video doorbell, receiving alerts for presses or motion near the door.
5.  **Window/Door Sensor Alerts:** Sensors on entry points trigger alarms and alerts if opened while the system is armed.
6.  **Water Leak and Smoke/CO Detection Alerts:** Receive critical alerts on your phone for environmental hazards like leaks or fires, even when away.
7.  **Scheduled Arming/Disarming:** Automate arming the security system at night or when leaving, and disarming upon return, ensuring consistency.

Implementing these often requires a central smart home hub to connect various devices and set up rules.
