Here are some of the best security automations for your smart home:

1.  **Automated Locking and Unlocking:** Smart locks can automatically lock after a set period, or unlock/lock based on user presence (via geo-fencing or phone proximity). You can also automate granting temporary access codes for visitors or deliveries.
2.  **Motion-Activated Lighting:** Link motion sensors (indoor or outdoor) to smart lights. When motion is detected, lights turn on automatically, which can deter intruders or simply light your way.
3.  **Triggered Camera Recording and Alerts:** Set security cameras to automatically start recording and send you a notification when motion is detected or when another sensor (like a door/window sensor) is triggered.
4.  **Scheduled or Presence-Based System Arming/Disarming:** Automate your security system to arm when you leave your home (using geo-fencing on your phone) or on a set schedule (e.g., every night). The system can disarm automatically upon your return.
5.  **Integrated Alarm Triggers:** Connect door/window sensors, motion sensors, or glass break sensors directly to your alarm siren. If a sensor is tripped while the system is armed, the siren sounds automatically.
6.  **Smart Deterrence Scenes:** Create automations that combine multiple actions. For example, if an unauthorized entry is detected, turn on all interior and exterior lights, sound the alarm, and start all cameras recording simultaneously.
7.  **Safety Sensor Integration:** While primarily for safety, integrating smoke, carbon monoxide, or water leak sensors can trigger security actions like unlocking doors for firefighters or shutting off water valves.
