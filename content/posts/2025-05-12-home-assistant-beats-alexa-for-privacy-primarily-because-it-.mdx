Home Assistant beats Alexa for privacy primarily because it is designed as a self-hosted, local-first platform, whereas Alexa is a cloud-based service. With Home Assistant, data processing, device control, and automation all happen on hardware you own within your home network. Your voice commands (if using a local voice assistant setup), device states, and usage patterns are not sent to external servers unless you explicitly configure them to be. As open-source software, its code can be inspected for transparency. In contrast, Alexa sends vast amounts of data, including voice recordings, device information, and interaction data, to Amazon's cloud servers for processing and storage. This fundamental difference in architecture gives Home Assistant users significantly more control and assurance that their sensitive smart home data stays private and within their own control.
