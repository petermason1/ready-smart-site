# Smart Toilets Are Here — and They’re Actually Brilliant

Forget everything you thought you knew about toilets — the new wave of smart loos is turning heads in 2025. They don’t just warm your seat and flush hands-free. The best ones now offer:

## 1. Health Monitoring

Some models analyse… yes, *that* — and can flag potential issues early. It sounds wild, but it’s already being trialled in homes across Japan, and it’s coming to the UK.

- Track hydration levels
- Monitor glucose or pH (in development)
- Export health data to your phone

## 2. Voice-Activated Cleaning

Hands-free flushing? Old news. Some smart toilets let you say:

> “Alexa, deep clean the loo.”

And it does. UV sterilisation, deodorising, and self-cleaning bowls are becoming standard in high-end models.

## 3. Heated & Motion-Activated Everything

- Heated seat & water
- Motion lid opening
- Ambient lighting for night use

## Should You Get One?

Prices are dropping — mid-range smart bidet units now start under £500 and retrofit to your existing toilet.

They’re not just for luxury anymore — they’re hygienic, energy efficient, and surprisingly smart.
