# Automate Your Lights Like a Pro

Smart lighting isn’t just convenient — it can make your home feel alive while cutting down on wasted energy. Here’s how to automate your lighting like a pro using motion, sensors, and smart rules.

## 1. Motion Triggers

Use motion sensors in:

- Hallways and landings to turn lights on only when needed  
- Bathrooms or utility rooms to auto-off after a delay  
- Entryways for a welcoming, hands-free experience

## 2. Time of Day Logic

Set up routines that only trigger lighting based on time conditions:

- Turn on porch lights **at sunset**  
- Enable nightlights between **10 PM and 6 AM**  
- Dim bedroom lights gradually after dark

## 3. Presence Detection

Make your lighting feel truly intelligent:

- Combine **motion + presence sensors** to avoid lights staying on when nobody’s home  
- Use your phone’s location to trigger whole-house modes (like “Away”)

## How to Set It Up

You can start with **Home Assistant Blueprints** or use **Alexa/Google routines** if you're cloud-based. Most sensors are compatible with both.
