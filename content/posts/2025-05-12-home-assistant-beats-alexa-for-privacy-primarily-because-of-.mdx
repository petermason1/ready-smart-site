Home Assistant beats Alexa for privacy primarily because of its architecture and data handling model. Home Assistant is open-source and designed for local operation, meaning user data (like device states, automations, and voice commands if processed locally) stays within the user's local network by default and is not sent to external servers unless explicitly configured. Users have complete control over their data. In contrast, Alexa is a cloud-based service where voice commands are typically processed on Amazon's servers. While Amazon has added privacy features, the fundamental model involves sending data to Amazon's cloud. Amazon's business model also involves data collection, creating different incentives compared to Home Assistant's community-driven, open-source model. This difference in where data is processed and stored, and who controls it, is the key reason Home Assistant is considered more private.
